```lrc
[00:00.04] Beneath the moonlit sky
[00:04.40] As the rain is passing by
[00:08.36] There's a heart turned pale
[00:13.67] Depths of night entwine your plight
[00:17.52] Breeze whispers hope's magic light
[00:23.08] Let me tell your tale
[00:33.58] 
[00:27.15] Lonely cat, lovely lonely cat
[00:41.65] 
[00:40.51] The mist's veil fades, memories appear
[00:47.83] A serenade
[00:51.31] Guiding your night to dreams, dear
[00:55.27] Raindrops trickle down, echoing your cries
[01:04.10] Reflecting your eyes
[01:06.79] Hopping out of hope
[01:16.29] 
[01:38.69] Night's sighs fly, chasing a star
[01:45.92] A lullaby
[01:49.63] Answering wishes far away
[01:53.48] Lost in cold
[01:55.15] The tale of your tender soul unfolds
[02:13.15] 
[02:02.24] So lovely lonely cat
[02:12.24] 
[02:08.50] As the night slowly turns to day
[02:15.49] With every step you take, your paws carrying your hope
[02:24.12] Those mem'ries you cope
[02:27.98] Are they real? Or just a dream?
[02:43.48] 
[03:05.55] Beneath the moonlit sky
[03:09.92] As the rain is passing by
[03:13.61] There's a heart turned pale
[03:19.32] Depths of night entwine your plight
[03:23.29] Breeze whispers hope's magic light
[03:28.07] Let me tell your tale
[03:38.57] 
[03:32.45] Lonely cat, lovely lonely cat
[03:46.95] 
[03:46.34] The mist's veil fades, memories appear
[03:53.11] A serenade
[03:56.95] Guiding your night to dreams, dear
[04:00.80] Raindrops trickle down, echoing your cries
[04:09.58] Reflecting your eyes
[04:12.36] Hopping out of hope
[04:21.86] 
[04:44.18] Night's sighs fly, chasing a star
[04:51.34] A lullaby
[04:55.28] Answering wishes far away
[04:58.92] Lost in cold
[05:00.55] The tale of your tender soul unfolds
[05:18.55] 
[05:07.86] So lovely lonely cat
[05:17.86] 
[05:14.31] As the night slowly turns to day
[05:20.75] With every step you take, your paws carrying your hope
[05:29.75] Those mem'ries you cope
[05:33.43] Are they real? Or just a dream?
