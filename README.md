[00:00.04] Beneath the moonlit sky
[00:04.49] As the rain is passing by
[00:08.39] There's a heart turned pale
[00:13.67] Depths of night entwine your plight
[00:17.56] Breeze whispers hope's magic light
[00:23.00] Let me tell your tale
[00:33.50] 
[00:27.14] Lonely cat, lovely lonely cat
[00:41.64] 
[00:40.54] The mist's veil fades, memories appear
[00:47.87] A serenade
[00:51.39] Guiding your night to dreams, dear
[00:55.29] Raindrops trickle down, echoing your cries
[01:04.10] Reflecting your eyes
[01:06.79] Hopping out of hope
[01:16.29] 
[01:38.66] Night's sighs fly, chasing a star
[01:45.94] A lullaby
[01:49.69] Answering wishes far away
[01:53.40] Lost in cold
[01:55.13] The tale of your tender soul unfolds
[02:13.13] 
[02:02.21] So lovely lonely cat
[02:12.21] 
[02:08.57] As the night slowly turns to day
[02:15.40] With every step you take, your paws carrying your hope
[02:24.18] Those mem'ries you cope
[02:27.90] Are they real? Or just a dream?
[02:43.40] 
[03:05.54] Beneath the moonlit sky
[03:09.91] As the rain is passing by
[03:13.61] There's a heart turned pale
[03:19.39] Depths of night entwine your plight
[03:23.21] Breeze whispers hope's magic light
[03:28.03] Let me tell your tale
[03:38.53] 
[03:32.40] Lonely cat, lovely lonely cat
[03:46.90] 
[03:46.33] The mist's veil fades, memories appear
[03:53.16] A serenade
[03:56.90] Guiding your night to dreams, dear
[04:00.83] Raindrops trickle down, echoing your cries
[04:09.53] Reflecting your eyes
[04:12.35] Hopping out of hope
[04:21.85] 
[04:44.12] Night's sighs fly, chasing a star
[04:51.36] A lullaby
[04:55.20] Answering wishes far away
[04:58.99] Lost in cold
[05:00.55] The tale of your tender soul unfolds
[05:18.55] 
[05:07.89] So lovely lonely cat
[05:17.89] 
[05:14.39] As the night slowly turns to day
[05:20.75] With every step you take, your paws carrying your hope
[05:29.74] Those mem'ries you cope
[05:33.44] Are they real? Or just a dream?
